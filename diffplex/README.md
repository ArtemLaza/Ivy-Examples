# DiffPlex â€“ Text Comparison Tool

An Ivy example demonstrating text comparison and diff visualization using the DiffPlex library.

## What It Does

This example shows how to compare two text blocks and highlight their differences. It displays:
- **Inserted lines** (additions in Text B)
- **Deleted lines** (removals from Text A)
- **Modified lines** (changes between versions)
- **Unchanged lines** (matching content)
